[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

## Some notes about "Deep Learning Specialization" are uploaded. 
This can be called a huge project to summarize it. Please check out `00 Notes` folder at first. 

## Other folders are my assignments of this class, which consists of five courses.
This special course consists of five courses:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning: **Assignments 01, 02, 03, 04, 05**
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization: **Assignments 06, 07, 08, 09, 10**
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects: **No assignments**
4. Convolutional Neural Networks: **Assignments 11, 12, 13, 14, 15**
5. Sequence Models: **to be continued**


**1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
- This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions.


**2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization**

When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications.
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking,
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.


**3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects**

You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error.
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning


**4. Convolutional Neural Networks**

This course will teach you how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
- Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
- Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.


**5. Sequence Models**

This course will teach you how to build models for natural language, audio, and other sequence data. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
- Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis.
- Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.
